Difficult:
Write a function that creates fake data for your database (for example, generate names, last names, phone numbers,cars info, etc). At first, don't worry about the fact that the names are random collection of letters "ksdfjhasdAASD". Later, think about how this could be improved and actual names be generated. Perhaps make a fixed list of names, last names, car makes, models to choose from and generate pick them randomly

Select all customers and their corresponding car information (if any)
Find all customers who own a car made before a specific year (e.g., 2000).
Find all female customers with a phone number starting with a specific code (e.g., 370).
Get the full names (first and last) of customers and the model year of their car (if any), sorted by year (ascending)
